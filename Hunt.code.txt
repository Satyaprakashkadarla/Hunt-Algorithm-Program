Since the "Hunt algorithm" isn't a recognized algorithm in computer science, there aren't standard input and output steps associated with it. However, based on the Python implementation provided earlier, I can outline the input and output steps for the Hunt algorithm described in that implementation:

Input:

Sorted array (arr): An array of elements sorted in ascending order.
Target value (target): The value that you want to find within the array.
Output:

Index of the target value (result_index): If the target value is found within the array, the algorithm returns the index of the target value. If the target value is not found, it returns -1.
Here's a summary of the steps:

Provide a sorted array (arr) and a target value (target) as input to the hunt_algorithm function.
The algorithm searches for the target value within the array.
If the target value is found, the algorithm returns the index of the target value.
If the target value is not found, the algorithm returns -1.
Example:

//code 
# Input
arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]
target = 9

# Output
result_index = hunt_algorithm(arr, target)

# Display Output
if result_index != -1:
    print(f"Target {target} found at index {result_index}.")
else:
    print(f"Target {target} not found in the array.")
In this example, the target value 9 is found at index 4 within the array [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15], so the output would be: "Target 9 found at index 4."
